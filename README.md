# Asset Status

Early scaffolding for MakeHaven’s asset status and maintenance logging module.

## Scope

- Structured log entries for asset reports, maintenance, and status changes.
- Workflow-ready fields that track member-reported vs. staff-confirmed status.
- Future dashboards, notifications, and AI assistant integrations.

## Status

This module is not yet functional. It currently provides entity scaffolding to be filled in iteratively.
